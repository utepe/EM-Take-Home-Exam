# EM Take-Home Exam
Write a software program, in any language (e.g., python, C, Java etc.) or system (Mathematica, Matlab, etc.) to solve for (a) inductance, 𝐿𝑡𝑜𝑡, (b) and capacitance, 𝐶, of a coaxial cable
The total inductance, 𝐿𝑡𝑜𝑡, includes both internal, 𝐿𝑖𝑛, and external, 𝐿𝑒𝑥𝑡, inductances (𝐿𝑡𝑜𝑡=𝐿𝑖𝑛+𝐿𝑒𝑥𝑡). assume 𝜀_𝑟=1 and 𝜇_𝑟=1 .
Plot the capacitance, 𝐶, and the external inductance, 𝐿𝑒𝑥𝑡, as a function of 𝑏/𝑎 from 1.1<𝑏/𝑎<10 and show that 𝐿𝑒𝑥𝑡𝐶=𝜇𝜀.
